<h2>System Analysis: The Tower 2018-2024
</h2>


<p>The home page for current The Tower and its archive is cluttered. From the huge title that takes up the top half of a laptop or tablet screen, to the thin crawl with small flashing icon, to the huge color-saturated slideshow of images from margin to margin, the page feels busy. Admittedly, I am not the audience or intended user that the interface was designed for. Suprizingly, the page has multiple heuristic design flaws and weaknesses that become strengths when viewed on a cell phone. This critique will only focus on the placement for the archives on the home page in medium screen format, as well as, the design that favors small device formats. This article will also evaluate information gathered from a usability test,  to critique search capabilities.
</p>

<p>When accessed on a laptop, many of the flaws violate Nielson’s eighth heuristic principle: Aesthetic and Minimalist Design. The placement of the “archive” on the home page for the college newspaper is unnecessary. The Tower archive is important information that requires its own dedicated page and listing on the navigation bar, rather than being crammed onto the landing page. However, the archive panel runs down the right side of the page in a single-item (month/year) format from November 2024 to September 2015. The linked monthly publication dates continue past the end of thumbnails indicating featured articles for the current or searched for dates. The archives panel proceeds past links indicating 330 pages just like this one. The list of dates continues down the right side of a long stretch of white space. Finally scrolling upon two very oddly placed ads for the business school, past a duplicate of some of the previously listed articles “you may have missed” comes the bottom page band with the very same archival listing in the same long, single item format.
</p>

<p>First impressions of the page design presents a concept that prioritizes filling every space with information, thus threatening cognitive overload. Next, the tenth heuristic principle—Help and Documentation—is also violated by lack of space to explain the number below each month/year. After taking the time to figure out that the numbers represented the number of articles in the archives for that time period, the question remains. Why do some months have 1 or two articles, while others have up to 100 articles. With a page dedicated to the archives, such clarifying information can be included.

<p>While looking for good images on my phone, I inadvertently discovered that The Tower site is better adaptable to small screen formats. The page is designed with student-on-the-go simplicity when viewed on a cell phone screen, which is the device of choice for an increasing number of college-aged learners and users. While the placement of the archive is problematic in both small and large-screen formats, on a cell phone the design is logical.
</p>

<p>First appears the reasonably sized title surrounded by lots of white space. Next is the black navigation banner with minimalist design: three short white stacked lines indicating click for a list of navigation options, and the white magnifying glass indicating a search bar are all that appear. Next is the yellow banner with a pulsating bullet point indicating “flash story” above a thin crawl of links to articles of interest. It is a well-placed quick reference tool since the articles for the month are listed by thumbnail in a single file as you scroll down the cell phone page. This time, the user scrolls to the end of the archives with the only wasted white space being the result of the single file format rather than columns. The two business school ads are perfectly placed, yet the bottom band again displays archive links in the same long-list format.

 <p>An information seeker, particularly a college freshmen, would find The Tower archive useful when seeking to explore CUA student attitudes about relevant social issues. A keyword search for “abortion,” for example, returns eight pages of articles on the topic going all the way back to December 2015; while, a search for the term “Black Lives Matter” returns three articles. However, if the student searches the term without prentices (“ ”) they will get five pages of results, with multiple relevant returns. Most were false results that can waste an inexperienced student’s time. The system can be improved by following Nielson’s tenth principle that calls for “Help and Documentation.” A simple short explanation of how to search would make the process more user-friendly for students. Further, once on an article page, the searched for keyword or phrase should be highlighted to make scanning for relevance easier.
</p>


<p>One thing the site does right is embedding links in the article to credible outside sources such as The Washington Post, The New York Times, NPR, CNN, as well as in-house sources. Another strength is the flexibility of the key word search or clicking on the known month and year for the information the user is seeking. While The Tower information system is a good source for exploring student attitudes at any given time up to 2015, teachers should be aware of and possibly prepare students for the difficulties they will encounter. A quick assessment by the teacher will reveal the following:
</p>
<p>
Weaknesses
<ul>
<li>Lack of instructions.</li>
<li>Irrelevant returns.</li>
<li>Interface, when viewed on large screens, is not user friendly.</li>
</ul>

Strengths
<ul>
<li>User friendly design on cell phone.</li>
<li>In-document links to supporting articles in reputable outside sources, which can also become part of the assignment.</li>
<li>Flexibility to search by keywords or browse the months and years.</li>
</ul>

<h2> Usability Test for The Tower Archive (1922-1914)
</h2>

<p>It was interesting that my subject for the useability test had no problem at all with the interface for the current Tower newspaper. 
 She viewed it on a large screen desktop right after spending :05 minutes on the old archive which frustrated her. She was not happy to have to return to the old archieve to complete the task.</p>



<p>She searched in silence, except for the occasional curses under her breath. She spent :05 minutes searching the old archive as if she was a student confused by the returns from the quick search bar. 
That search went to multiple archives, none of which listed The Tower. She knew the dates of the conflict, so she clicked on the newspaper icon for 1941 to 1960. Then she selected November 1941, to see 
if there was anything published on the topic before the US joined the conflict. Next, she went to December 1941 and clicked on the twelfth.  It excited her because it was exactly what she was looking for.
However, she was surprised and perplexed that the archive skipped all of 1945, the year WWII actually ended. Using that same method, she continued her search. 
Using the “search inside” feature she scanned through several pages for several months. Running out of time, she decided to move on to the Vietnam War, but ran out of time before finding any meaningful search returns.</p>

<p>
 When I interviewed her, I asked what she thought about the database. She began listing of reasons.
<ol>
<li> The system is old, like pre-Y2K old and hard to use.</li>
<li> The search icon is misleading because it draws from other university archives.</li>
<li> The “object type” filter on the left is confusing because it does not list The Tower, but “Islandora Newspaper Issue Content Model.”</li>
<li> It took me a while to figure out how to search.</li>
<li> That interface thingy where pages appear is awkward.</li>
<li> There is nothing telling people how to find the screen view with the “text,” “pdf” and “TIFF” options. I found it by accident the first time, but couldn’t find it again.</li>
<li> The system just takes too much time to figure out.</li>
</ol>
 She said she would never use the database for class assignments. “It’s unfortunate because the archive itself is a valuable resource,” she said. 
 “I would love to assign my upper classmen a paper comparing the sociopolitical attitudes of CUA students with those of Howard University during the 1960 and 70s. 
 She showed me their newspaper archives. 
 It is much more user friendly. 
 “I searched as if I was a student,” she said, “and I cannot do that to them. I would find appropriate articles and print them for the class. I don’t like the database for myself either.
